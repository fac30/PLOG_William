## Guidance
Answer the following questions considering the learning outcomes for
- [Week 08](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/developer/week08-project04-test-deploy/learning-outcomes/)

Make sure to record evidence of your processes. You can use code snippets, screenshots or any other material to support your answers.

Do not fill in the feedback section. The Founders and Coders team will update this with feedback on your progress.

## Assessment
 ### 1. Show evidence of some of the learning outcomes you have achieved this week.
1. Learn how to write unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests using testing frameworks like Cypress.
   - wrote unit test to test the functionality of getting data from sqlite database.
   - wrote integration test to test the whole functionality of an express route such as /tutors and /login.
2. Understand the importance of code organisation, modularity, and reusability.
   - Reorganised express routes into a single import file to clear import bloat in the server file.
   - Refactored passport strategy to have more descriptive variable names.
   - Refactored middleware for authentication to only be used in routes that requires it.
3. Solidify typescript skills
   - Continued usage of developing the bakend with typescript.

4. Configure the necessary environment variables and settings for deployment
   - Used environment variables to control the functionality of local development and production environments.
5. Gain experience in deploying a full-stack web application to a cloud platform
   - deployed project on render and netlify
6. 

 ### 2. Show an example of some of the learning outcomes you have struggled with and/or would like to re-visit.
 1. Gain experience in using a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline
    - would like to design and create more github actions to automate testing and deployment processes.
 2. Writing more advanced middleware to have a stronger grasp of error handling for server routes.
